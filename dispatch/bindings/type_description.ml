  (** Abstract base type for all dispatch objects.

  (** Dispatch queues invoke workitems submitted to them.

      Dispatch queues come in many flavors, the most common one being the
      dispatch serial queue (See dispatch_queue_serial_t).

      The system manages a pool of threads which process dispatch queues and
      invoke workitems submitted to them.

      Conceptually a dispatch queue may have its own thread of execution, and
      interaction between queues is highly asynchronous.

      Dispatch queues are reference counted via calls to dispatch_retain() and
      dispatch_release(). Pending workitems submitted to a queue also hold a
      reference to the queue until they have finished. Once all references to a
      queue have been released, the queue will be deallocated by the system. *)
  let dispatch_queue_t = dispatch_object_t

  (** Dispatch global concurrent queues are an abstraction around the system
      thread pool which invokes workitems that are submitted to dispatch queues.

      Dispatch global concurrent queues provide buckets of priorities on top of
      the thread pool the system manages. The system will decide how many
      threads to allocate to this pool depending on demand and system load. In
      particular, the system tries to maintain a good level of concurrency for
      this resource, and will create new threads when too many existing worker
      threads block in system calls.

      The global concurrent queues are a shared resource and as such it is the
      responsiblity of every user of this resource to not submit an unbounded
      amount of work to this pool, especially work that may block, as this can
      cause the system to spawn very large numbers of threads (aka. thread
      explosion).

      Work items submitted to the global concurrent queues have no ordering
      guarantee with respect to the order of submission, and workitems submitted
      to these queues may be invoked concurrently.

      Dispatch global concurrent queues are well-known global objects that are
      returned by {!dispatch_get_global_queue}. These objects cannot be
      modified. Calls to {!dispatch_suspend}, {!dispatch_resume},
      {!dispatch_set_context}, etc., will have no effect when used with queues
      of this type. *)
  let dispatch_queue_global_t = dispatch_queue_t

  (** Dispatch serial queues invoke workitems submitted to them serially in FIFO
      order.

      Dispatch serial queues are lightweight objects to which workitems may be
      submitted to be invoked in FIFO order. A serial queue will only invoke one
      workitem at a time, but independent serial queues may each invoke their
      work items concurrently with respect to each other.

      Serial queues can target each other (See dispatch_set_target_queue()). The
      serial queue at the bottom of a queue hierarchy provides an exclusion
      context: at most one workitem submitted to any of the queues in such a
      hiearchy will run at any given time.

      Such hierarchies provide a natural construct to organize an application
      subsystem around.

      Serial queues are created by passing a dispatch queue attribute derived
      from DISPATCH_QUEUE_SERIAL to dispatch_queue_create_with_target(). *)
  let dispatch_queue_serial_t = dispatch_queue_t

  (** The type of the default queue that is bound to the main thread.

      The main queue is a serial queue (See dispatch_queue_serial_t) which is
      bound to the main thread of an application.

      In order to invoke workitems submitted to the main queue, the application
      must call dispatch_main(), NSApplicationMain(), or use a CFRunLoop on the
      main thread.

      The main queue is a well known global object that is made automatically on
      behalf of the main thread during process initialization and is returned by
      dispatch_get_main_queue(). This object cannot be modified. Calls to
      dispatch_suspend(), dispatch_resume(), dispatch_set_context(), etc., will
      have no effect when used on the main queue. *)
