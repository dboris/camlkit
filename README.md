## Overview

Camlkit provides OCaml bindings to the following Cocoa frameworks:
* [Foundation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation?language=objc)
  (on all platforms)
* [AppKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit?language=objc)
  on macOS and [GNUStep](https://gnustep.github.io/)
* [UIKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit?language=objc)
  on iOS and [macOS (via Mac Catalyst)](https://developer.apple.com/mac-catalyst/)
* [WebKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit?language=objc)
  (on all platforms)

## Features

* Using the classes and objects from the above Cocoa frameworks, defining new
  Cocoa classes, and accessing the functionality of other Cocoa frameworks
  (via the lower-lever Objective-C runtime API bindings) can be done from the
  comfort of OCaml. No need to write wrappers manually in C or Objective-C.
* Cocoa object lifetimes can be managed by the OCaml GC.
* The bindings in the above frameworks follow the Cocoa method naming and the
  underlying typing closely. More convenient and idiomatic OCaml wrappers are
  planned and will be added to the Camlkit package for the most used classes
  and methods.

## Sample programs

A few sample programs are provided in the
[example](https://github.com/dboris/ocaml-objc/tree/main/example) directory.

## Project status

The project is in active development but is still experimental. It can be
considered at the alpha stage. At the moment documentation is virtually
non-existent. The best way to get started is to peruse the sample programs and
use them as a starting template. Read the Apple documentation for the classes
and methods of interest. All books on iOS and macOS development in Objective-C
are directly applicable.

## Related projects

For iOS and Mac Catalyst development you will need to set up a cross-toolchain
from [opam-cross-ios](https://github.com/ocaml-cross/opam-cross-ios).
